# Property Logic interview task

The attached project has been started but not completed.

Your task is to:

1) Fix (improve) the testCannotMoveMoreThanOneSquare() test
2) Implement code to make testCannotMoveMoreThanOneSquare() pass
3) Implement code to make testThatKingIsAllowedToCastle() pass
4) Comment on why these tests might not be satisfactory
5) Comment on to what degree this project adheres to SOLID principals

You may also clean up code smells and fix other issues you notice.

We would like your response within about a week of receiving the project.

Tip: The main trick of the project is in managing the dependency that becomes
obvious when you implement King::isSuitableCastlePresentForCastling().  We're
interested in how you manage and test this dependency.

## About the project

This is the beginning of an imaginary chess project.

You should not need to know the game of chess in order to write this project.  We have tried to comment on the function
exactly what the rule requirement we are trying to fulfill is.

Chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner.
