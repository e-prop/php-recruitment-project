# Property Logic interview task

## About the project

This is the beginning of an imaginary chess project.

You should not need to know the game of chess in order to write this project.  We have tried to comment on the function
exactly what the rule requirement we are trying to fulfill is.

Chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner.

You can find out more on [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)

We would like you to take a look at the project and be prepared to discuss it with some of our team members.

## Your task

The attached project has been started but not completed.

Your task is to:

1) Fix (improve) the testCannotMoveMoreThanOneSquare() test
2) Implement code to make testCannotMoveMoreThanOneSquare() pass
3) Implement code to make testThatKingIsAllowedToCastle() pass
4) Comment on why these tests might not be satisfactory
5) Comment on to what degree this project adheres to SOLID principals

You may choose to make any sort of changes or refactoring that you would like to do
in order to support implementing these features.  For example, you will need to
have a way to test if a piece has moved or not so adding a new class property is acceptable.

You may also clean up code smells and fix other issues you notice, but this
is less important than your OOP design skills.

We don't want you to spend huge amounts of time on this.  If you spend
about 2 hours on the project and feel comfortable to talk through it
with the team then that's enough.

We would like your response within about a week of receiving the project.

Tip: The main trick of the project is in managing the dependency that becomes
obvious when you implement King::isSuitableCastlePresentForCastling().  We're
interested in how you manage and test this dependency.
